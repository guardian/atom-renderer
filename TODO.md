# TODO

In order of priority:

- [ ] Add AB testing infrastructure
- [ ] Add reader questions atom type
- [ ] Use SASS for CSS
- [ ] Testing and linting
- [ ] Dynamic resource bundles -- there may be a lot of redundancy between the JS/CSS of two different atom types
- [ ] Autoprefix class names in the HTML with the `atom--` string
- [ ] Minify the CSS
- [ ] Tree-shake the CSS
- [ ] Replace Twirl -- definitely not a fan. I thought, being a very natural Scala extension (at least for Scala developers) would make it useful, but it proved to be more painful than anything. I may switch to JSX or a language of my own designing.


# Roadmap for v1

- [ ] Use Web Components
