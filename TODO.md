# TODO

## New features

- [ ] AB testing service
- [ ] Feature switch service
- [ ] Config service for customization

## New atom types

- [x] reader questions
- [ ] explainer
- [ ] quizz
- [ ] media
- [ ] review
- [ ] recipe
- [ ] cta

## Improvements

- [x] Use SASS for CSS
- [x] Substitute TypeScript for Flow in JS
- [ ] Testing and linting
- [ ] Tweak snippet styling
- [ ] Use ImgX for responsive images
- [ ] Dynamic resource bundles -- there may be a lot of redundancy between the JS/CSS of two different atom types
- [ ] Autoprefix class names in the HTML with the `atom--` string
- [x] Minify the CSS
- [ ] Tree-shake the CSS
- [ ] Replace Twirl -- definitely not a fan. I thought, being a very natural Scala extension (at least for Scala developers) would make it useful, but it proved to be more painful than anything. I may switch to JSX or a language of my own designing.

# Roadmap for v1

- [ ] Use Web Components
