# TODO

Some features that can be added later to the library:

- [ ] Autoprefix class names in the HTML with the `atom--` string
- [ ] Minify the CSS
- [ ] Tree-shake the CSS
- [ ] Replace Twirl -- definitely not a fan. I thought, being a very natural Scala extension (at least for Scala developers) would make it useful, but it proved to be more painful than anything. I may switch to JSX or a language of my own designing.
